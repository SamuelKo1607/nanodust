# nanodust
The project to look for nanodust on Solar Orbiter, heavily inspired by my older project for micron size dust on Solar Orbiter. 

Data inputs include .cdf data files from Soolar Orbiter archive and UiT locally produced CNN classification files, visit https://github.com/AndreasKvammen/ML_dust_detection.
